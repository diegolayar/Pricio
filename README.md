# Pricio

Pricio is a price checking app created to help alleviate the problems that come along with the hyperinflation crisis 
in Venezuela. Not only canâ€™t businesses print new price labels every single day as prices adjusts to the economy, but 
aggravating lines pile up to ask for the price of a product at the cashier, only to later drop the item off because the 
price is out of their budget. Pricio lets users check prices of items in real time as well as keep track of their total
to pay by adding such items to the cart. It also serves as a powerful feature for store owners to update prices according
to their current accepted exchange rate, while avoiding the disheartening lines that make customers not want to shop.
